Running a local LDAP test server for development purposes
=========================================================

This should be done as a normal user - NOT root.

Copy the setup.sh-dist file to a file of your own (e.g. setup.sh).
Edit it and make sure that the PATH that it builds will contain
a consistent set of LDAP tools. Many distros spread these around
in three places, often something like:
	/usr/bin
	/usr/lib/openldap
	/usr/sbin

Create a symlink to the schema directory that is used by those programs
e.g.:
	ln -s /etc/openldap/schema ../schema/std

Now, whenever you need this test environment, you do:

	cd /path/to/this/devslapd
	. setup.sh

You can then use commands like:

	x-rebuild
		Clear out and rebuild the test server (and start it)
	x-start-ldap
		Start the test server
	x-stop-ldap
		Stop the test server

	x-anon-search uid=myusername
		Search as anon
	x-root-search sn=some-surname
		Search with root's power

Note that all these commands will only work while in the directory
containing the 'vars' and 'slapd.conf' files as they pick up config
using relative paths. This does allow you to set up several different
test environments very easily.

The test server listens on port 1389 so if you want to access it with normal
command-line tools you need to do something like this:

ldapsearch -x -H ldap://:1389/ -b dc=mozillians,dc=org '(uid=gerv)'
